# Flow

Here is a flow of the conversations. The first conversation is the "bad" flow, the second conversation is the "good" flow

## First Conversation

| product  | software engineer  |
|---|---|
|Hey Chris, Can you add these analytics to our App? Here's the requirements (Speech bubble) | |
| |Sure, I'll get right on it (Speech bubble) |
| ~~~ some time later ~~~ | |
|Hey, Chris, not all the requirements are coming through, did you implement them all? (slightly angry) (Speech bubble) | |
| | oh no, I'll double check the code and make a fix (embarassed) (Speech bubble) |

## Second conversation

| product  | software engineer  |
|---|---|
|  Hey Chris, Can you add these analytics to our App? Here's the requirements (Speech bubble) | |
| | Sure, I'll get right on it (Speech bubble) |
| | Compiler says you haven't implemented all Analytics (thinking) (thought bubble) |
|~~~ some time later ~~~  | |
|Thanks Chris, we can see all the requirements (happy) (Speech bubble) | |
| | Smiling, no problem  (Speech bubble) |



## Requirements

Product & Software Engineer are two different people, they are talking to each other.
The people picture variations are:
- product talking to software engineer
- software engineer talking to product
- software engineer thinking
- software engineer embarassed
- product angry
- product happy

There are "Speech Bubbles" where one person is talking to another, and "Thought bubbles" where the person
is thinking to themselves

The conversation may change over time, so it would be great if the people/speech bubbles were components that can be re-used
